# SensitiveAnalysis
This project is aimed to distinguish reviews into postive or negative statements.
The dataset is available in: http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/aclImdb_v1.tar.gz

I adopte two kinds of machine learning methods, which are deep learning and classification. 
For deep learning method, I build model with multi-layer perceptron and recurrent neural network (RNN). 
For classification method, I adopte support vector machine(SVM).
